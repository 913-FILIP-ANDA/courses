1. This year, as freshman I managed to complete the following:
	a. Had a skype interview at Palantir
		-> went well and they invited me in London for onsite interviews
		-> got rejected after the interviews because I am too young
	b. Had two interviews at Google
		-> got rejectected without any feedback, advised to reapply next year
	c. Will have an interview at Amazon:
		-> really simple 3 problems on Codility
	d. Should have an interview with Microsoft
		-> hope I will do good there and get an internship...
