Q5_pt = "Revenge? Revenge! The King under Joyous is dead and where are his kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Lyres is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons' sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong, Thief in Gulfs!"
