<h1 id="lab-7-design-process">Lab 7: Design Process</h1>
<p>The final project should be accompanied by a “process book” which documents your development process. Following today’s lecture about the design process and sketching, we ask you to focus on the following aspects of your project. Your responses will become a part of the process book which has to be submitted and graded with the final project.</p>
<p>Please be as specific (concrete) as possible. If it turns out that the data does not support your planned conclusion, you can document the change later.</p>
<p>The crucial part is sketching your planned visualization. We would be interested to see it, during the exercise or alternatively, submitted to a form we will announce (this submission is not graded, the graded part is the process book submitted with the final project).</p>
<h3 id="the-story">The story</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the main insight / story that you want to convey?</li>
<li>Brainstorm: please propose several ideas.</li>
<li>Choose the idea you like the most and explain your choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>What data is required?</li>
<li>How are you going to get it? (and how long will it take?)</li>
<li>What is the structure of the data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="related-work">Related work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is there an existing visualization / presentation of the data?</li>
<li>If so, what are its problems and how can we improve upon it? (For example: draw better insights, improve interaction or presentation.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-audience">Target audience</h3>
<p>What knowledge or skills are needed to understand your presentation?</p>
<p>The topic may be accessible to the general public if it concerns matters familiar for everyone (for example taxis in New York). Alternatively, it can be targeted at experts in the field instead (although that may be difficult as you probably are not experts in that field).</p>
<p>Please avoid “person interested in X”, try to imagine a realistic and specific example instead.</p>
<h3 id="interaction">Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>What kind of interaction is planned?</li>
<li>What questions the users might have and how will they be able to ask for this information?</li>
<li>Is is possible and useful to compare things?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sketch">Sketch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please draw (whatever graphics program you want, or even hand drawn and scanned/photographed) how your visualization is going to look. It does not need to be perfect of detailed, but should express your idea.</li>
<li>If there are multiple views, please put them side by side.</li>
</ul>
