**Author: Cosmin Rusu**
**October 2015**

## Problem statement
John wants to **manage his bank account**. In order to complete this task, John needs an application to
store, for a certain month, all the banking transactions which were performed on his account. Each
transaction will be stored in the application through the following elements: day (of the month in
which the transaction was made), amount of money transferred into/from the account, the type of the
transaction (into the account â€“ in or from the account - out), and description of the transaction. Please
help John to create an application in order to repeatedly execute the following functionalities (each
functionality is exemplified):
