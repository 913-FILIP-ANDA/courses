##Minimum cost walk by dynamic programming
- Let `dp[k][x]` = the minimum cost walk of at most k edges from s to x
- So `dp[0][s] = 0` and `dp[0][x] = oo for every x != s`
- dp[k][x] = min({dp[k - 1][y] | (y, x) is an edges in the Graph)
- Small piece of code:

```c++
memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
```
