So we have a buffer overflow with a buffer size of 240.

I've put the shellcode at the beginning of the buffer. Basically our memory looks like this:

--------------
|return addr |
|  ebp       |
|------------| <- start of buffer
|------------|
|------------|
|------------|
|------------|
...
|------------|
|------------| <- end of buffer

The total size of buffer is 240 characters.

So, we need to get the address of buff and override the return address witht that buff address.

I've used gdb to get the buff starting address and override the return addr with that address,
and I've put 'A' elsewhere between.

For gdb, I've put a breakpoint before the strcpy function (line 14), and then runned the command
x/a buf to get the address of the buffer.
