# Exam to Parallel and Distributed Programming `feb 2018, subject no 3`

1. (3p) Write a parallel or distributed program that counts the number of subsets of `k` out of `N`
that satisfy a given property. You have a function (`bool pred(vector <int> const& v)`) that
verifies if a given subset satisfies the property. Your program shall call that function once for
each subset of `k` elements and count the number of times it returns true.

see: `comb_async.cpp`
