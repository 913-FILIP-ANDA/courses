# Parallel and distributed programming *project*
Team members: @rusucosmin & @platonv


## Theme
*Applying a simple filter on an image (e.g., a convolution/linear filter).*
We've chosen to add a grayscale filter on the image.


## Common requirements
* Each student or team of 2 students will take one project. It is ok to take a theme that is not
listed below (but check with the lab advisor before starting).
* Each project will have 3 implementations
    1. one with "regular" threads or tasks/futures
    2. one distributed (possibly, but not required, using MPI).
    3. a third implementation, using OpenCL or CUDA, can be made for a *bonus*.

## Tasks
For each implementation described in the requirements, we created a task.
The documentation for each task can be found in the folder of that specific task.
